      <h1>Hey I'm Steph üêï</h1>
      <p>You know those speed walkers at
the mall? I'm like them but with dogs! I studied
Veterinary Technology at Delhi (the SUNY
school) and I've been around animals all my life. I
can adapt my energy to each dog much like
those annoying crystal girls you know. I'll take
good care of your dog and make sure it has the
best walk of THEIR (pronouns!) life. I also send
videos while walking so you feel like you're there
with your pooch, giving you a few seconds to
dissociate where you are!
<br></br>
<br></br>
I service all animals with all types of care! From dog walking, to cat feeding, to snake charming! I have years of experince and I studied Vet Tech in college! I do 15/30/45/60 minute walks, overnight sits and boarding. I can administer medications, basic dog training, and provide nonstop love and affection room for your fur baby!</p>
